# predict student performance based on week-wise clickstream data
### We develop the LSTM framework to predict risky students. We are using the public dataset OULAD https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset to verify the LSTM model. The prediction accuracy is improved over weeks.

### We take the course FFF as the example. We first extract the daily click behavior for students admitted in the course FFF and then aggregate them into week-wise data. Then we run the LSTM model to predict student performance.
